# (CLONE) iPhys: An Open  Non-Contact  Imaging-Based  Physiological  Measurement Toolbox
In the past few years a lot of attention has been given to methods for remotely measuring physiological signals using low-cost cameras.  Imaging PPG (iPPG) focuses on the measurement of volumetric changes in blood flow at distance from the body using imaging devices to capture changes in transmitted or reflected light. Imaging ballistocardiography (iBCG) typically leverages optical flow estimation to track the vertical motion of the head or body from a video sequence. Both iPPG and iBCG methods can be used to recover human vital signals.

This toolbox contains MATLAB implementations of a number of algorithms for non-contact physiological measurement. This will enable researchers to present results on their datasets using standard public implementations of the baseline methods with all parameters known. The toolbox includes implementations of many of the most commonly used baseline methods for imaging photplethysmography (iPPG) and image ballistocardiography (iBCG).

## Background: ## 

Imaging photoplethysmography (iPPG) has developed as a method for capturing the BVP signal remotely using digital cameras and ambient light. Almost any digital camera (i.e., webcam or cellphone camera) is sufficiently sensitive to capture the pulse signal when the subject is close to the device.  Poh et al. (2010) proposed the use of Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to recover the pulse signal and enable a fully automated iPPG framework.

Methods inspired by optical models of the skin have helped advance the state-of-the art. The CHROM (2013) method uses a linear combination of the chrominance signals and makes the assumption of a standardized skin color profile to white-balance the video frames. 
The plane orthogonal to the skin (POS [2017]) algorithm assumes the presence of a pulsatile color space signal and posits that this will be orthogonal to the skin color space.

## Usage: ##

The scripts have been created to allow easy processing of any video dataset.  We have also included example data in the "test_data" folder.

Each method takes the following inputs:

*       VideoFile         =       Video file path.

*       FS                =       Video framerate (fps).

*       StartTime         =       Timepoint at which to start process (default = 0 seconds).

*       Duration          =       Duration of the time window to process (default = 60 seconds).

*       ECGFile           =       File path to corresponding ECG data (.mat) file containing: 1) The waveform - ECGData.data, 2) The ECG sampling rate - ECGData.fs, 3) The ECG peak locations (in samples) - ECGData.peaks.

*       PPGFile           =       File path to corresponding PPG data (.mat) file containing: 1) The waveform - PPGData.data, 2) The PPG sampling rate - PPGData.fs, 3) The PPG peak locations (in samples) - PPGData.peaks.

*       PlotTF            =       Boolean to turn plotting results on or off.

And produces the following output:

*        BVP              =    The predicted blood volume pulse signal.

*        PR               =    Estimated Pulse Rate (PR) from BVP timeseries using peak in periodogram.

*        HR_ECG           =    Gold standard reference Heart Rate (HR) measured from the ECG timeseries.

*        PR_PPG           =    Pulse Rate measured from the PPG timeseries for the window.

*        SNR              =    Blood Volume Pulse Signal-to-Noise Ratio calculated based on the ECG HR frequency.


### Example: ###
DataDirectory           = [cd '\test_data\'];

VideoFile               = [DataDirectory 'video_example.mp4'];

FS                      = 30;

StartTime               = 0;

Duration                = 60;

ECGFile                 = [DataDirectory 'ECGData.mat'];

PPGFile                 = [DataDirectory 'PPGData.mat'];

PlotTF                  = false;


[BVP, PR, HR_ECG, PR_PPG, SNR] = ICA_POH(VideoFile, FS, StartTime, Duration, ECGFile, PPGFile, PlotTF)
